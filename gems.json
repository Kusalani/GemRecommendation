Moreover, diamond engagement rings with medium to lower grade diamonds have suffered a slight drop in popularity among millennials, enough to cause DeBeers to decrease their prices by 9%.\n\nWhile diamond is the hardest gemstone, its all-round durability is considered less than that of relatively softer gemstones, such as sapphires and rubies, which can garner higher prices due to their toughness.",

Wearability is graded as excellent, very good, poor, and display only;\n\nGemstone hardness is one of the primary factors when making this comprehensive determination of wearability.\n\nFor example, gemstones such as opal (Mohs 5.5 - 6.5), moonstone (Mohs 6 - 6.5) and pearl (2.5 - 4.5), are considered to have poor wearbility and should, therefore, be worn in earrings and pendants. If you have your heart set on wearing a soft gemstone in a ring, make sure to set it in a low, protective setting with a lot of metal, such as gold, which is easy to polish and replace. This type of ring should only be worn occasionally to minimize the risk of scratching.\n\nRubies and sapphires (Mohs 9) and diamonds (Mohs 10) are considered to have excellent wearability and it is, therefore, recommended that they can be used for any setting and worn for any occasion, especially for everyday use.",

Despite its name, chrysoberyl, which is an aluminate of beryllium, does not actually belong to the beryl mineral group, but rather, it is classified as its own independent mineral group.\nThe history of alexandrite is quite controversial, dating back to the times of Imperial Russia. It is said that the stone was named after the Russian tsar, Alexander II (1818 - 1881), but it was discovered by a Finnish mineralist called Nils Gustaf Nordenskiöld (1792 - 1866). When Nordenskiöld first discovered alexandrite in 1834, it was initially thought to be an emerald because it was discovered in emerald mines located in Russia's Ural region, near the Tokovaya River. The specimen was later identified as a chromium bearing, color change variety of chrysoberyl. Legends claim that the discovery of alexandrite was made on the very day the future tsar of Russia became of age. Inevitably, the red and green color change stone was to be declared the official gemstone of Imperial Russia's Tsardom.\nThe color change phenomenon seen in alexandrite is referred to as the 'alexandrite effect'. The change in color can be observed under certain lighting conditions, typically under daylight and incandescent lighting. Alexandrite is also a strongly pleochroic gem. It can display emerald green, red, orange and yellow colors depending on which angle the stone is viewed from. The pleochroic properties of alexandrite are completely independent from its unique color change ability. Typically, alexandrite exhibits an emerald-green color in daylight, and raspberry-red under incandescent lighting. Alexandrite can also occur with yellowish and pink colors, and extremely rare specimens can exhibit chatoyancy (cat's eye) effects when cut en cabochon. The color change 'alexandrite effect' is a result of the strong absorption of light in the yellow and blue portions of the color spectrum.",

Some ordinary colored agates can be colored with chemical solutions to produce more vibrant gemstones. However, expensive heat treatments are not commonly applied to agate due to its affordability. The historical techniques of dyeing agate have been practiced for centuries, particularly by German gem cutters who imported agates from Brazil and developed methods to transform the dull gray stones into more beautiful and colorful varieties such as red agate (carnelian), blue agate, green agate, brown agate, and yellow agate using various chemical solutions.

When hot molten rock rises to the surface crust of the Earth and cools, gas bubbles, cracks, and cavities form within the lava. As the lava hardens into rock, these spaces remain. Silica-rich fluids containing dissolved quartz molecules flow into these pockets over time. Under the influence of pressure, temperature, and mineral impurities, these fluids crystallize, creating the colors and patterns found in agates. Over millions of years, erosion exposes the hard agates, and they are washed away by streams and creeks, eventually ending up in river beds or alluvial deposits where they can be collected by miners.

Egyptians, around 3500 years ago, obtained colorful agates from the Achates River on the Mediterranean island of Sicily, which led to its modern name 'agate.' Ancient Egyptian royalty adorned themselves with agate ornaments and jewelry, and agate carvings dating back to the Bronze Age have been discovered in Knossos on the Greek island of Crete. Agate cutting and polishing have been practiced in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, for over 500 years, with mining activities dating back 3000 years. The discovery of high-quality dyed agates in Germany and later in Brazil further fueled the popularity of agate in the gemstone industry. ",

These voids give agate its porous nature, allowing dyes to penetrate and create permanent color changes within the crystal.

Sapphires and rubies are the same mineral, corundum, with color variations attributed to trace elements like titanium, copper, and magnesium for sapphires and chromium or iron for rubies. Sri Lanka's historical association with heat treatment dates back to ancient times. Techniques practiced in Ratnapura, known as the City of Gems, involve using charcoal, coconut husks, and blow tubes to improve the clarity and color of sapphires. These methods are still in use today, allowing Sri Lanka to produce exquisite sapphires with enhanced visual appeal. The most famous and sought-after sapphires from Sri Lanka are the Padparadscha variety, known for their pinkish-orange hues. Sri Lanka's expertise in heat treatment techniques and the production of high-quality sapphires have solidified its position as one of the world's leading sapphire producers. ",

Hundreds of millions of years ago, this landmass broke up, and India and Sri Lanka moved northwards, eventually crashing into Asia and creating the Himalayas. As a result of these geological processes, most of the gemstones mined in Sri Lanka are classified as secondary mineral deposits. These gemstones have broken free from their original enclosures in rocks and have been washed into rivers and streams by rain over time. Miners retrieve these gemstones from river beds or by digging shallow tunnels into sedimentary or alluvial deposits. In some cases, rich veins of gemstones are accidentally discovered by farmers when they turn over the soil in fertile valleys. The geological history of Sri Lanka and the formation of secondary mineral deposits have contributed to the island's reputation as a prolific producer of colored gemstones, making it a gemstone powerhouse rivaling other major gem-producing countries like Brazil and Russia.

The brilliant cut excels in maximizing light refraction due to its numerous facets, which interact with light and create heightened brilliance. On the other hand, the cabochon cut does not offer the same level of light reflection as the brilliant cut. The smooth, rounded surface of the cabochon cut allows less light to be reflected within the gemstone, resulting in a gentler and more subdued appearance.

Cabochon-cut gemstones offer a timeless and vintage appeal, often used in classic jewelry designs or as centerpieces in statement pieces. Their unique visual characteristics make them a favorite choice for jewelry designers and collectors who appreciate the beauty of these non-faceted gems. ",

While faceted gemstones showcase sparkle and light play, plain-cut gemstones and cabochons emphasize the gem's color, texture, and natural beauty. - Plain-cut gemstones and cabochons differ significantly from faceted gemstones in their appearance and optical effects. Faceted gemstones exhibit brilliance and sparkle due to their multiple surfaces interacting with light, creating a captivating play of colors. In contrast, plain-cut gemstones and cabochons lack facets and have a smoother, more subdued appearance. This cutting style allows the gem's inherent color, texture, and natural beauty to be the focal points. While faceted gemstones are ideal for showcasing brilliance and light performance, plain-cut gemstones and cabochons celebrate the gem's purity and character. This difference in appearance makes plain-cut gemstones and cabochons favored choices for vintage-inspired and bohemian-themed jewelry, where a softer and more natural appearance is desired. In certain gemstones, such as opals and jade, the cabochon cut is specifically chosen to highlight special optical effects like chatoyancy (cat's eye) or asterism (star effect). Designers and collectors appreciate the diversity provided by both faceted and plain-cut gemstones, each offering a unique perspective on the gem's beauty and character. ",

For example, Burmese rubies are known for their unique inclusions, such as unusual crystal formations, which distinguish them from rubies found in other locations. African rubies, on the other hand, may have distinct inclusions that reflect the geological processes of their formation, setting them apart from Burmese rubies. By studying these inclusion \"signatures,\" gemologists can provide valuable insights into a gemstone's provenance and assist in confirming its authenticity. The connection between gemstone inclusions and origin identification is a crucial aspect of gemstone evaluation, trade, and appreciation, as it helps to ensure transparency and trust in the gemstone market.

When compared to plain-cut or cabochon-cut gemstones, which lack facets, brilliant-cut gemstones exhibit significantly heightened sparkle and brilliance. The abundance of facets in the brilliant cut ensures that light is effectively reflected out through the gemstone's top surface, allowing its colors to shine brightly and captivate the viewer.

In contrast, single-cut gemstones feature a consistent faceting style throughout the entire gem. - Mixed-cut gemstones differ from single-cut gemstones in their approach to faceting. Mixed-cut gemstones combine various faceting styles on the gemstone's surface, resulting in a diverse blend of cuts. In contrast, single-cut gemstones feature a consistent faceting style throughout the entire gem. For example, a mixed-cut gemstone might have one side with a round diamond-cut and another side with a scissor cut, creating a unique and visually captivating appearance. On the other hand, single-cut gemstones maintain a uniform faceting style on all sides, creating a consistent and balanced look. The choice between mixed-cut and single-cut gemstones depends on the desired jewelry design and the gem's inherent qualities. Mixed-cut gemstones offer creativity and versatility, allowing designers to experiment with different faceting styles to showcase various aspects of the gem's beauty. In contrast, single-cut gemstones provide a straightforward and classic appearance, emphasizing the gem's brilliance and clarity without distractions. Both mixed-cut and single-cut gemstones contribute to the diversity and artistry of gemstone cutting, catering to various design preferences and individual styles. ",

Color is a crucial determinant, encompassing hue (the main color), tone (lightness or darkness), and saturation (intensity or brightness). For example, a highly valued topaz might be described as \"intense yellowish-red.\" Clarity refers to the absence of significant inclusions or blemishes visible to the naked eye. A high-quality topaz usually exhibits excellent clarity. Cut plays a role in highlighting a topaz's brilliance while minimizing any window effect. Gem cutters create various faceted shapes to showcase the gem's clarity and brilliance optimally. Finally, carat weight, representing the gem's size, is a consideration when selecting topaz. Evaluating topaz quality using these parameters assists customers in making informed choices and acquiring gemstones that meet their preferences and expectations. ",

This property enables quartz to generate electricity or electrical polarity in response to applied mechanical stress or voltage. This discovery led to the development of highly accurate quartz oscillators used in quartz clocks. Until the adoption of atomic clocks in the 1960s, quartz clocks were the most accurate timekeeping devices in the world. Additionally, tourmaline's pyroelectric properties, which generate electric charge in response to temperature changes, have been used in pressure-sensitive gauges, particularly in submarine applications during the Second World War. The discovery and understanding of these special properties have significantly impacted technology and various industries, highlighting the importance of gemstone research and exploration in uncovering new applications for these valuable materials.

This misidentification led to the classification of golden citrine, smoky quartz, and peridot as topaz. Furthermore, the large clear topaz crystals found in nature sometimes resembled diamonds, resulting in instances where topaz was mistaken for these precious stones. Even crown jewels in Portugal and Saxony were discovered to have diamonds that turned out to be topaz. By the 18th century, scientific advancements allowed for the identification of topaz based on its distinct gemological properties, helping to distinguish true topaz from other gemstones.

Its hardness of 8 on the Mohs scale allows for various fancy cuts, including concave cuts, resulting in stunning jewelry designs. The gem's wide color variety ensures easy matching with different jewelry alloys, from silver to gold. However, topaz does have perfect cleavage, making it more susceptible to splitting along the direction of its crystals during cutting and mounting processes. While normal daily wear is unlikely to break a topaz gemstone, care should be taken to avoid sharp blows and contact with hard materials that could chip or scratch the gem. Enhanced topaz, like Mystic Topaz with a coating treatment, may require extra protection in jewelry settings to prevent scratches on the coating. Understanding the properties and characteristics of topaz helps jewelry makers and buyers appreciate its beauty and ensure proper handling and care of this captivating gemstone. ",

While gemstone healing has a long history and cultural significance, it lacks scientific evidence to support its claims of therapeutic value.

Despite this skepticism, many people still believe in the healing powers of gemstones, offering personal accounts of positive experiences.

The historical significance of Imperial Topaz is rooted in its association with the Ural mountains in Russia, where the term \"Imperial\" was derived from the pink topaz mined in honor of the Russian Czars. With the depletion of Russian mines, the gemstone's rarity has further increased, enhancing its value and desirability among collectors and gemstone enthusiasts. As one of the rarest and most valuable types of topaz, Imperial Topaz continues to captivate the gemstone world with its captivating colors and limited availability. Understanding the geographic sources of Imperial Topaz allows gem traders and collectors to appreciate its unique origin and cultural significance, further enriching the appreciation of this exceptional gemstone.
